Project 2: Processing

I was inspired by the site http://www.flashbox.co.kr/,
where music albums are combined with animation on the
backscreen. I conbimed the song, background of the album,
and the internet link in this project.

I am not a efficient coder, so I had to go through alot
of trouble drawing each bars and animating them.
The Play button plays the song obviously, but the Link
button will direct the user to the youtube music video
of the song.

The bar animation on the top screen has nothing to do
with the song, it is just there to show off. The white
box at the middle shows the lyrics, which the user can
progress with the enter button. Read the lyrics, and 
press enter to see more. I did many experiments in this
project, so there are some codes that I blanked out.
