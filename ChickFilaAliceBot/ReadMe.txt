Chick-Fil-A clerk bot

Menu:

One: chicken sandwich

Two: nuggets (8 or 12)

Sprite or Coke (small, medium, large)

Fries (small, medium, large)

Based on GT Chick-Fil-A menu. no complicated things such as "I want one number 1 and eight piece nuggets with medium sized coke." Instead the bot handles those menus one by one.
